When I first started working on this table it got confused since my coding was not organized and was scattered all over the place. It was difficult to figure out the errors I had on my table. Anyway, I analyised every single detail of my coding and it turned out that I was missing ">". So when ever your coding always make sure to look for the obviuse things and always try to be neat with your coding.</h2></td>
